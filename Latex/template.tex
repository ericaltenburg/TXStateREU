\section{Introduction}
As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology improves, these devices become more and more integrated into society as they allow for tasks to be easily completed by a user in a route location. For example, Amazon and other distribution companies are developing methods that use these devices to deliver packages to their users in a fast and simple manner. Aside from being able to easily deliver packages, it is possible that by replacing delivery trucks all together, the total amount of emissions could be reduced which would have an overall positive impact on the environment. This technology is not limited to the aforementioned companies, instead, it is also used by archeological sites and other sports companies to conduct surveillance missions for certain dig sites where a camera might not be the best choice, or at a football game. Another use these UAVs have are with the police force as there are often situations where it is not entirely safe to send in an officer, however, by allowing that officer to remotely control a drone, it allows him and many others to be safe.\par

One of the many things holding UAVs back from doing such things are the simple fact that the battery usage is not easily predictable. By having the ability to know how much battery a given drone will consume can put the user at a much higher advantage as they can now determine whether or not a certain flight mission is feasible. Going back to the previous example with Amazon, their delivery drones will not always be charged to maximum capacity, therefore, if they can see how much battery a delivery will take up, then they can determine whether or not they will need to send a different drone or replace the battery. Up until now, most UAV software can only communicate to the user how much battery is remaining in real time, and while that may be enough, in some situations—like the one mentioned previously—it is important to know how much will be consumed before the UAV leaves the ground.\par

While there have been some attempts at creating such a model, there has not been a successful method that results in an accurate or efficient prediction. This is partially due to drones being relatively new, having only been introduced in the past few years, and as a result, not much research has been conducted. It is from this lack of literature that many have had difficulty creating a functional model. Specifically, one of the assumptions made about these drones is that the total battery energy consumption is constant from flight-to-flight \cite{Prasetia}, however, through various data samples, this is not the case; it is variable. This and many other assumptions make up some of the shortcomings in existing literature, that if not proven correctly, can result in a considerable setback in the UAV field. 


\section{Related Work}
With very few pieces of literature in the field of UAV battery consumption, there were a select few that stood out. Previous attempts at creating a similar model have attempted to separate the maneuvers a UAV performs during its flight into separate categories such as vertical hover, and horizontal movements \cite{Prasetia}. While others took a more detailed approach and had back, down, forward, roll left, roll right, up, yaw left, and yaw right \cite{Corral}. Although these two studies were not entirely successful, they were still able to provide motivation to isolate the maneuvers into ascending, descending, hovering, and any horizontal movement.\par

As previously stated, these studies come with slight caveats. For the case of the detailed maneuver model, the data they collected on their quad-copter showed surprising results as shown in Figure 1. Here, they were able to map the current in Amps being drawn by each maneuver and deduced that down and roll left consumed little to no battery; up consumed the most; back, forward, roll right, yaw left, and yaw right consumed an amount in between the others. There are some aspects of this finding that raised concern, for example, roll left consumed a minuscule amount of current whereas roll right consumed much more. This puts roll left on the same level as moving down which should not happen. \par


\subsection{Improvements}
After collecting data from several flights, there was no similar pattern to that of their original findings, therefore, leading to the conclusion that roll left did not consume less power than roll right. Additionally, another finding in the data set showed that the differences in power consumption between all maneuvers in the horizontal plane were minute, thus allowing the classification of maneuvers to only include ascend, descend, hover, and horizontal movement. However, it is important to note that the UAV they used had four total rotors (quad-copter) while the one used primarily in this project had six rotors (hexa-copter) which could lead to a difference in results.
